 # JS UI Documentation
Welcome to JS UI Documentation, everything you need to know about working with JS-UI CSS and related tools can be found here. 



## The JS UI 
JS UI is a component library that you can develop very quickly without requiring any framework. It is a general UI library. The difference from other UI libraries is that you can style your HTML code in a class just like you write CSS in classes inside any HTML tag.
So how do you start? Check out our [getting started guide](/getting-started) to understand how it works and go from there.
